# Pokédex
This project is an interactive Pokédex developed using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, consuming the PokeAPI. It demonstrates the integration of an external API to create a dynamic user experience, allowing users to browse and view detailed information about Pokémons.

### Features
Pokémon Listing: Displays a paginated list of Pokémons with their name, number, types, and image.

Load More: A button that adds more Pokémons to the list, simulating an infinite scroll feature.

Pokémon Details: When a Pokémon is clicked, the screen is replaced with a detailed view that includes complete stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed) and a back button.

Back Button: Allows the user to easily return from the detailed view to the Pokémon list.
